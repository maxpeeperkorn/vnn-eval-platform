# Contributing

This repo is the **VNN-COMP variant** of the
[core evaluation platform](https://github.com/TUMcps/core-eval-platform): the `vnn_comp` plugin app
plus its deploy config. All the heavy lifting lives in core; this repo holds the VNN-specific seams,
step handlers, and node scripts.

## The core submodule

The core engine is vendored as a git submodule at `./core`, pinned to a specific commit for
reproducible dev and deploy. A recursive clone brings it along; if you already have a checkout
without it:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

The compose stack mounts `./core` (backend) and `./core/frontend` (Vite), so a normal
`docker compose up --build` runs against the pinned core with hot reload.

### Updating the pinned core

Move the pin with the helper shipped in core, then commit the change:

```bash
core/scripts/bump-core.sh          # latest core main
core/scripts/bump-core.sh dev      # ...or a branch, tag, or commit
git commit -m "chore: bump core"   # records the new pin
```

When a change spans both repos, merge the core change first, then bump this repo's pin to it.

## Tests

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/core:/core" -v "$PWD:/vnn" -w /vnn python:3.11-slim \
  sh -c "pip install -q -e '/core[dev]' -e /vnn && pytest"
```

## Continuous integration

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs for pushes to every branch, pull
requests, and manual dispatches. It runs the plugin and pinned core Python tests, tests and builds
the shared frontend, validates the Compose configuration, and verifies that the backend tooling
base image builds. The checkout steps initialize the pinned `core` submodule automatically.
